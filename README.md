A bite-sized RPG, written in C, where you're the underdog hero tasked with taking down the big bosses of three villainous races. The problem? You SKIPPED Hero classes!! But don't sweat it, because your secret weapon isn't muscles, it's brainsâ€”and a nifty Analyze skill.

Here's the twist: your Analyze skill isn't just about peeking behind the curtain; it presents a riddle. Crack the riddle, and you'll uncover the turn when your foes are wide open for a whopping 100%+ extra punch (also called a z00m). Outsmart your enemies, crack their secrets, and save the day with sheer wit!
